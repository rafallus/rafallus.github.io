Programmer and contributor to the [**Godot Game Engine**](https://godotengine.org).
I've great experience coding in <span class="hl-skill">**GDScript**</span>, <span class="hl-skill">**C++**</span> and <span class="hl-skill">**GDNative**</span>.
I've designed AIs using **State Machines**, **Behavior Trees**, and **Hierarchical Task Networks** (HTN).
I also have some experience using <span class="hl-skill">**C#**</span> and [**Unreal Engine**](https://www.unrealengine.com/).
I've worked on 3D and 2D projects in addition to UI design.
I also have a taste for making art, and know how to use tools like [**Blender**](https://www.blender.org/) for 3D modeling and [**Inkscape**](https://inkscape.org/) for vector graphics.
